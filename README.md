# Amortizer - Simple loan amortization calculator

*Amortizer* is a simple amortization table generator which supports two common approaches: annuity payments and straight amortization. 


## Overview

*Amortizer* is basically a single python class which instantiates an object with several useful methods.

| Method | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| **.get_summary(method="annuity")** | Calculates amortization dataframe (methods: 'straight' or 'annuity') and returns a dictionary with summary statistics. |
| **.straight_amortization()** | Calculates amortization table with straight amortization and returns a dataframe. |
| **.annuity_amortization()** | Calculates amortization table with annuity payments and returns a dataframe. |
| **.to_html(method="annuity")** | Calculates amortization dataframe (methods: 'straight' or 'annuity') and returns results to a string with html markup. |
| **.to_json(method="annuity")** | Calculates amortization dataframe (methods: 'straight' or 'annuity') and returns results to a string with JSON object. |
| **.to_csv(path: str, method="annuity")** | Calculates amortization dataframe (methods: 'straight' or 'annuity') and exports results to the .csv file. |

Learn more about the methods above in the [Documentation][docs]
